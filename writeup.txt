1. Name and linkblue ID of each member in your group.

	Name (Linkblue ID)

	Sharan Ravula (sra361)
	Ivan Garcia (iaga224)
	Tucker Baum (taba259)

2. A brief statement on the contribution of each group member in finishing the assignment.

	We have two versions of the code. I (Sharan Ravula), used python to complete this assignment as I was having trouble with c++, and my other team members used c++.
	
	a. Sharan Ravula (python) :

		Implemented the Python version of the cryptanalysis solution.
		Conducted frequency analysis on the reference text to identify letter frequencies.
		Developed the mapping algorithm to map encrypted characters to plaintext characters.
		Deciphered the encrypted text using the finalized mappings and linguistic knowledge.
		Compiled the documentation detailing the solution design, implementation steps, and execution instructions.

	b. Ivan Garcia (C++):
		
		Implemented the C++ version of the cryptanalysis solution.
		Conducted frequency analysis on the reference text using C++ data structures and algorithms.
		Assisted in refining the mapping algorithm based on frequency analysis results.
		Tested the C++ program and provided feedback on optimizations and improvements.

	c. Tucker Baum (C++):
	
		Collaborated on the development of the C++ version of the cryptanalysis solution.
		Assisted in designing the frequency analysis algorithm and data structures.
		Contributed to the testing and debugging of the C++ program.
		Reviewed the implementation and provided suggestions for code optimization and efficiency.
